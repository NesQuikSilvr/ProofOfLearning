    Define four functions:
        - Open Claw
        - Close Claw
        - Arm Up
        - Arm Down

    - None of the functions will take any input and will move the servos to specific positions
    - Save each specific servo position as a global variable (open, close, up, down)

    Rewrite the code you wrote in "basics.c" using your ARM and CLAW functions

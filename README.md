# Proof of Learning Instructions

The solution for each of these problems can be done on:
    - The simulator https://www.botballacademy.org/sim
    OR
    - A physical robot

## There are 2 sections

### 1 - ALL STUDENTS should do the following folders:
- Basics
- Functions
- Conditionals with Sensors

Pick one file to work on for each folder.


### Folders titled "Team X" should be done by students in the corresponding team

**The problems should still be done INDIVIDUALLY**

Each team folder has multiple code files that are all part of the same project.

Read "main.c" in your team folder for specific instructions.

    Instructions:

    For the Botball competition, Team 2 used header files and additional source files to
    organize their code and split up the missions between team members.


    There are three missions declared in "missions.h".

    Write the code for each mission function in their respective "missionX.c" file.

    Call each mission function in main() below.


    EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS FOR Anh-Thu, Nataly, and Adara: also work on "extra.c"

//Include the missions header file to call the mission functions in main() below
/* YOUR CODE HERE */

int main() {

    //Call each mission function here
    /* YOUR CODE HERE */
    
    return 0;
}
